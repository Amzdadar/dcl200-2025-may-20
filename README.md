## Introduction

Java is a powerful programming language widely used for building applications. However, performance issues can arise due to various factors. This repository aims to provide guidance on how to optimize Java applications for better performance. 

In this repository, you'll find information on different Java versions, garbage collection methods, and profiling tools. Each section will help you understand how to improve your application's efficiency.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers the following topics:

- **G1GC**: The Garbage First Garbage Collector is designed for applications that require predictable pause times.
- **Java Flight Recorder (JFR)**: A profiling tool that provides insights into Java applications' performance.
- **Java SE**: The Standard Edition of Java, which is the foundation for building applications.
- **JDK 11, JDK 17, JDK 21**: Different versions of the Java Development Kit, each offering new features and improvements.
- **Modularity**: Techniques to organize your code into modules for better management and performance.
- **Virtual Threads (Java 21)**: A new feature that simplifies concurrent programming in Java.
- **VisualVM**: A tool for monitoring and troubleshooting Java applications.
- **ZGC**: The Z Garbage Collector, which focuses on low-latency performance.

## Performance Tuning Techniques

### 1. Understanding Garbage Collection

Garbage collection is a crucial aspect of Java performance. Choosing the right garbage collector can significantly affect your application's speed and responsiveness. 

- **G1GC**: This collector is suitable for applications with large heaps. It works by dividing the heap into regions and prioritizing garbage collection in areas with the most garbage.
  
- **ZGC**: This collector is designed for low-latency applications. It minimizes pause times, making it ideal for real-time systems.

### 2. Profiling Your Application

Profiling is essential for identifying bottlenecks in your application. 

- **Java Flight Recorder**: Use JFR to capture data about your application's performance. It provides insights into CPU usage, memory consumption, and thread activity.

- **VisualVM**: This tool allows you to monitor your application in real-time. You can visualize memory usage, thread activity, and more.

### 3. Code Optimization

Optimizing your code can lead to significant performance improvements. 

- **Modularity**: Break your application into smaller, manageable modules. This approach makes it easier to optimize individual components.

- **Use of Virtual Threads**: With Java 21, you can simplify concurrent programming. Virtual threads reduce the complexity of managing multiple threads, leading to cleaner and more efficient code.

## Tools and Resources

### Java Development Kits

- **JDK 11**: A long-term support version with many new features.
- **JDK 17**: Another LTS version that includes performance enhancements and new language features.
- **JDK 21**: The latest version, offering cutting-edge improvements.

### Profiling Tools

- **Java Flight Recorder**: Built into the JDK, it provides detailed insights into your application.
- **VisualVM**: An open-source tool for monitoring and troubleshooting Java applications.

### Documentation

- **Official Java Documentation**: Always refer to the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
